# QlikSenseEpic2015DLL
A dll that works with [QSTicketEpicModule](https://github.com/eapowertools/QSTicketEpicModule) to integrate Qlik Sense authentication with Epic Hyperspace.

The dll communicates with Epic Hyperspace to take settings from the application and make a request for Qlik Sense resources embedded in Epic.  If the user is not authenticated, the dll sends an encrypted token to the [QSTicketEpicModule](https://github.com/eapowertools/QSTicketEpicModule) for authentication to Qlik Sense.

##Requirements
- Qlik Sense Enterprise Server 2.2.4 and above
- Epic Hyperspace 2015 (version 8.2)

##Prerequisites
- [QSTicketEpicModule](https://github.com/eapowertools/QSTicketEpicModule): This solution implements the authentication scheme Epic will use to complete the handshake between Epic and Qlik Sense.  QSTicketEpicModule is installed on the Qlik Sense server.

7. Build the solution.
8. Copy/Paste the DLL to a folder on the system where Epic Hyperspace is installed.
9. Open a command prompt with administrator privileges and navigate to the folder the DLL was pasted to.
10. Run the following command line: `C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\regasm.exe QlikSenseEpic2015.dll /tlb /codebase`.  This command will register the DLL in the system registry and create a tlb file for Epic to use when loading the DLL. 
11. Navigate to the shared file folder location for Epic Hyperspace and create a file named `qliksenseepic2015.config`.
12. Open the `qliksenseepic2015.config` file and in the first line add `key=` and then a passphrase the dll will use to encrypt the userid of the user when transmitting to the Qlik Sense server.
13. Save the file.  The DLL is now installed and configured.
14. Restart Epic Hyperspace if it is currently running before attempting to connect to Qlik Sense using the DLL.
